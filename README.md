Objective:
Challenging role in a unix based applications environment that has a
net-positive effect on the world, and within society.
Recent Work:
Spent the last year+ consolidating a legacy DevOps environment located on rackspace to a new COE located on AWS. The COE was based on current cloud linux distributions, changing security practices, a migration from apache/haproxy to nginx, and developing deployment and build practices using AMIs. Helped design and implement best OPS practices while cutting overall OPS costs by one fifth.
Completed migrations from Jenkins to an in house continuous deployment framework.
Developed and executed plan for migration from Trac to Jira and Confluence, and from server based Postgres to RDS on Amazon. While in the process of migrations, on both server and software level, worked closely with developers and other groups helping facilitate incremental changes for the overall process.
Prior, worked on, and then sold my security web portal “nsa.org”. Linkedin has my most up to date information.
Points of Interest:
Twenty years of experience on the Internet in a myriad of settings encompassing industries such as gaming, energy, retirement, digital magazine distribution, home ownership, online entertainment and finally in university settings.
Worked closely with developers in environments based on c, java, perl, python, ruby, tcl, and obscure or proprietary based platform development options during all phases of an application life-cycle.
System architecture, design, build-out planning, and final roll-out of three co-location facilities as well as multiple in place expansion and upgrades of co-locations.
